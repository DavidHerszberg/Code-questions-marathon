#Given an integer array nums sorted in non-decreasing order,
# remove the duplicates in-place such that each unique element appears only once.
# The relative order of the elements should be kept the same.

#Return k after placing the final result in the first k slots of nums.

#Do not allocate extra space for another array.
# You must do this by modifying the input array in-place with O(1) extra memory.
def remove_duplicates(nums):
    # Fill this in.
